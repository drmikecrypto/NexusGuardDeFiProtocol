Base Risk Score Calculation:
```
R = Î£(Wi * Si) * Vm

Where:
R = Final risk score
Wi = Weight of factor i
Si = Score of factor i
Vm = Volatility multiplier

Components:
- Audit Score (W1 = 0.20)
- TVL Score (W2 = 0.30)
- Time Score (W3 = 0.15)
- Complexity Score (W4 = 0.20)
- Volatility Score (W5 = 0.15)
```
