Coverage Integration:
```
class CoverageManager {
    async purchaseCoverage(
        projectAddress: string,
        amount: BigNumber,
        duration: number
    ): Promise<CoverageDetails> {
        // Calculate risk score and premium
        const riskScore = await this.assessProjectRisk(projectAddress);
        const premium = await this.calculatePremium(amount, duration, riskScore);
        
        // Execute coverage purchase
        const tx = await this.protocol.purchaseCoverage(
            projectAddress,
            amount,
            duration,
            { value: premium }
        );
        
        // Wait for confirmation and return details
        const receipt = await tx.wait();
        return this.processCoverageReceipt(receipt);
    }
}
```
